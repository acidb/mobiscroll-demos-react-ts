## Demo description

Enforcing validation is essential to a great UX. First make sure to have the [min & max values right](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/datetime/min-max-restrictions#) and then work your way through disabled values.

Depending on your situation, you have two options:
- **Set invalid** - set the invalids through the `invalid` option.
- **Set valid** - set the valids through the `valid` option.

Both the `invalid` and `valid` options support the following:

- **Exact dates** - Passing exact values like: `'2020-05-20'` will disable/enable the specific day
- **Date ranges** - Passing `start` and `end` value pairs will disable/enable specific days and/or times that fall into that range
- **Recurring dates** - Passing recurrence rules as objects or in RRULE string format will be parsed. For [more information on recurrence check out the rule generator](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/datetime/recurring-values#)

Exact dates and the start/end pairs can be passed as [JS date objects, ISO date strings or Moment.js objects](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/datetime/date-object-ISO-8601-moment#).
Having invalids set up correctly not just enhances the UX, but improves performance.
