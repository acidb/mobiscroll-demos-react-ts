## Demo description

The date & time picker works with different date types:

- **JS date object** - a common way of passing a date is through a Date object: `new Date(1995, 11, 17, 15, 24)` (make sure to not simply pass a date string to `new Date()`)
- **ISO date string** - standardized way of passing dates: `'2008-09-15T15:53:00'` (make sure to pass it as a string)
- **Moment.js object** - a great solution that solves common date management difficulties: `moment([2018, 3, 27, 12, 15])` (make sure to have moment.js loaded)

When passing dates to the component - eg. [invalids](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/datetime/disabled-invalid-values#), [min/max](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/datetime/min-max-restrictions#) - you can do it in either format and the picker will automatically know what to do with it. If you want to specify how the picker should return values, you can do it in the `returnFormat` option.
