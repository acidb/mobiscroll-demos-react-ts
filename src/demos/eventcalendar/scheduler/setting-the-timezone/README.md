## Demo description

The event calendar works with local times by default, but ships with support for changing the timezone. The conversions and correct output relies on either of these three external libraries: [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) and [day.js](https://day.js.org/). For installing and using these libraries check out this guide.

There are two angles regarding timezones:

- `dataTimezone` - the calendar expects this format and returns this format. It is `'local'` by default if the date-times don't contain any timezone information.

It can be set globally on the calendar using the `dataTimezone` option, or
specifically for the event using the `timezone` property of the [event data](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/scheduler/event-data-structure#).

- `displayTimezone` - the calendar displays the events in this timezone. The date-times will be converted from the `dataTimezone` and displayed accordingly. It is `'local'` by default
